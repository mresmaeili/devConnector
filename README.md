# devConnector
Social Network Platform for developers.

Additional libs:

express-validator: when we make a post req to API, if there fields need to be that they aren't it'll raise an error

bcryptjs: password incription - no plain text pasword

config: for global variables

gravatar: profile avatars

jsonwebtoken: passes along a token for validation

mongoose: a layer on top of database so we can interact with it

request: making http requests to APIs
 
nodemon: constantly watch our server so we don't have to refresh it everytime we make a change
